# Arrangement Editor

The **Song Editor** plugin for [feedBack](https://github.com/got-feedback/feedback)
(plugin id `editor`) — a DAW-style timeline editor that turns a recording into
a playable feedBack chart: import a tab or start from audio, line the grid up
to the take, author every note, save the editable `.feedpak` project, and
export it to the targets where it will be played.

**New here?** The **[User Guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md)** (also in-app under
Help ▸ User Guide) walks the whole journey — create a project from a
recording, a chart, or both; fit the tempo map; chart the notes; add tracks,
stems, and drums; mix; save the project; and export it to the library.

It is the largest plugin in the ecosystem. If you are here to work on it,
read this top-to-bottom once — the architecture section saves real time.

## What it does

- **Start from anything** — audio (MP3/WAV/FLAC/OGG/M4A/OPUS/AAC/WEM, or a
  YouTube URL), Guitar Pro (GP3–GP8), MIDI (tempo map included), community
  arrangement XML, MusicXML keys scores, GoPlayAlong sync sidecars, existing
  `.feedpak`/archive files — or a blank timeline. Audio + chart together get
  **auto-sync**: the imported chart lines up to the recording bar by bar.
- **Edit like a DAW** — a canvas timeline with per-part views: String view
  (lanes per string), a piano roll (with resolver-assisted fretted
  authoring), a drum piece-lane grid, and a live engraved tab/score view.
  A Logic-style **tool palette** (`T`: pointer, pencil/draw, eraser, marquee,
  mute, scissors), four **shortcut profiles** (FeedBack / Logical / Cableton /
  Legacy-EOF), a searchable command palette (`Ctrl+K`), and a customizable
  canvas (grid strength, brightness, hue). Navigate a long arrangement with a
  real horizontal scrollbar and overview strip, per-view zoom (the piano roll
  stretches and compacts on its own), and Logic-style **Scroll in Play** that
  glides the timeline under a pinned playhead. Undo/redo is the edit contract:
  every mutation is a command with exec/rollback.
- **Time** — a beat-primary tempo map (`beatOf`/`timeOf` over one anchor
  set): Tempo Map mode fits the grid to a recording (sync points, tap tempo,
  metric modulation, beat-lock, assisted mapping, Map Health), snap rides the
  same converter (grid, onset, swing), and loop regions/bookmarks/count-in
  ride the transport. The authoritative musical ruler fits bars and beats to
  fixed source audio; authored musical content aligns through that ruler. See
  [`docs/TEMPO-MAPPING-DESIGN.md`](docs/TEMPO-MAPPING-DESIGN.md) for the four
  timing domains, marker model, assisted mapping, and audition-speed rules.
- **Tracks, stems, and the mixer** — tracks are first-class objects in a
  persistent track column: rename, reorder, fold into folders, pair a
  transcription with the studio stem it was charted against. Load
  per-instrument **stems** and chart against any of them in isolation. The
  **mixer console** (`Shift+C`) is vertical channel strips with live meters
  over SOURCE/GUIDE/CLICK buses and a MASTER output — every fader unity with
  +10 dB of headroom.
- **Hybrid guitar/bass tracks** — combine two synchronized, compatible fretted
  parts while keeping both originals unchanged. Automatic mode fills safe rests;
  Review Sections mode lets the player choose either track or mix notes in each
  different musical section. Repeated riffs can share one reviewed choice.
- **Keys with hands** — MusicXML imports keep the score's left/right hand
  split; hands are authorable per note or stamped by split point, shaded on
  the roll, and drive the grand-staff notation's hand split.
- **Companion strips & lints** — a fretboard strip for fretted parts
  (candidate positions from the suggest-position resolver, click to assign),
  a drum kit / pad strip (GM-mapped, MIDI-monitor capable), and advisory
  playability/limb lints that name physical questions without ever blocking.
- **Save and export are separate** — with the native file picker, Save preserves
  the editable `.feedpak` project at the location you choose and reuses that
  destination. Browser fallback downloads a copy but keeps the project marked
  unsaved because download completion cannot be verified. **Export to Library**
  assembles and publishes a playable library copy through the host's core
  libraries; export never pretends that unsaved project edits were saved.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `plugin.json` | Manifest: id, screens, `scriptType: "module"`, routes. |
| `screen.html` / `screen.js` | The screen DOM and the module entry stub (`src/main.js` is the real entry). |
| `src/` | The frontend, as native ES modules (see below). |
| `routes.py` | The FastAPI backend: session store, `import-*` endpoints, save/build. |
| `goplayalong.py` | GoPlayAlong sync-sidecar parser. |
| `tests/` | `node --test` suites (JS) + `pytest` suites (backend helpers). |
| `assets/` | Icon and the manifest stylesheet. |

## Developing

```bash
npm test                              # full JS suite (node --test over tests/)
node --test tests/loop_ab.test.js     # a single JS suite
npm run lint                          # ESLint over src/ + tests/ (via npx — see below)
python -m pytest                      # backend suite (needs fastapi/pyyaml installed)
```

Two rules that surprise newcomers:

- **No `node_modules`, ever.** The desktop bundler copies this whole
  directory into the packaged app (stripping only `.git`), so `npm run lint`
  shells out to a pinned `npx eslint` instead of installing anything.
- **ESLint's `no-undef` with `{ typeof: true }` is a correctness gate**, not
  style — it exists to catch identifiers left behind by module moves,
  including the `typeof x` reads that fail silently. Don't weaken it.

Frontend edits show on a browser refresh; `routes.py` changes need a server
restart. In the packaged app the host serves `src/` with live-edit caching.

## Architecture in five minutes

The frontend is ~50 ES modules under `src/`, orchestrated by a thin
`src/main.js`. The load-bearing invariants:

- **`src/state.js` exports `S`, the single mutable state object.** It is
  never reassigned — only its properties are. Tests seed it with
  `Object.assign`.
- **Every mutation goes through `S.history`** (`src/history.js`) as a
  command object with `exec`/`rollback`. `editGen` bumps once per committed
  edit; memos over note data key on it.
- **`src/host.js` breaks import cycles**: extracted modules reach the few
  main.js callbacks they need through one hook table. Anything main.js
  *reassigns* must be wired as a thunk — read the warning at the top of that
  file before adding a hook.
- **`src/beats.js` is the single time converter** (`beatOf`/`timeOf`). Beat
  coordinates are truth; seconds are derived. `TempoMapCmd` recomputes
  seconds from beats, `TempoGridCmd` re-lifts beats from seconds.
- **Modules must degrade under node** (no DOM, no host): inert defaults,
  no import-time side effects — that's how the real-import test suites work.
- **Global listeners and timers must register with the teardown registry**
  (`host.addGlobalListener`, tracked via `window.__editorScreenTeardown`):
  the host re-injects the screen, so anything unregistered leaks across
  re-injection. New chrome rides the rAF draw-coalesce — no per-frame work.
- **Kind inference drives a part's entire view** (string lanes vs piano roll
  vs drum grid): keys > drums > bass > guitar, with `KEYS_PATTERN`
  start-anchored ("Electric Piano" is not a keys name).
- **Never compose the capo pair blindly**: `_soundingPitchPure` adds the capo
  once (matching core's `pitch_from_base`); `_absolutePitch` deliberately
  omits it (string-move math). Both carry warning comments and a pinned test.
- **Transient per-note UI marks live in module `WeakSet`s, not note fields**:
  an underscore field leaks into the save body on solo notes and vanishes on
  chord notes (`reconstructChords` rebuilds via an explicit field mapper).

The backend (`routes.py`) keeps a `_sessions` dict keyed by session id, each
owning an unpacked working directory. Every import format normalizes through
its own endpoint into the same model; `/build` is the only path that writes
to the user's library. `_NOTE_TECH_FIELDS` is the single source of truth for
authorable note techniques — new ones go there, not in ad-hoc field lists.
When the editor and the host disagree about a field, the
[feedpak spec](https://github.com/got-feedback/feedpak-spec) wins.

## Testing conventions

New suites are **real-import ESM** (`tests/*.test.mjs`): import the actual
modules, seed the real `S`, stub only the DOM slice you need
(`tests/_history_env.mjs` is the template for history-driven suites). Older
suites slice functions out of the source text — when touching code they
cover, keep new globals `typeof`-guarded so their environments stay clean.

House rules: never stub the subject under test; round-trip every command
(exec → rollback deep-equality → redo); adversarial inputs; and a stateful
change needs a test that fails without it.

Every user-visible change adds a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]`.
